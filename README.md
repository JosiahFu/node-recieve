# `recieve`

Adds a command `recieve` to start a server that you can upload to from another computer.

## Usage

Install the package globally.

```bash
npm install -g @tater-archives/recieve
```

Run the command:

```bash
recieve
```

On another computer you (or someone else) can go to the URI `http://[YOUR IP ADDRESS]:3000` and upload a file, which will be saved in the current directory.

*Printing your IP address and configuring the port will be added in the future*
